	<h1> Love Ya!!!</h1>
	<p> No, I didn't write a "New Poem" so don't be so happy...duh!</p>
	<p> we MET in tution class,<br>
	 since 6 YEARS have pass</p>
	 <p>All of this started JUST with the NAME,<br>
	 And look today,so far we came</p>
	 <p>Just ONE CALL and you are THERE,<br>
	 	Friends like,now-a-days are RARE</p>
	 <p> Sometimes I share things with YOU and You with ME,<br>
	 	As TRUST in our friendship is the only KEY
	 	<p> There were times when things were NOT BRIGHT<br>
	 		But now I hope everything's ALRIGHT</p>
	 	<p> It's YOUR DAY today,<br>
	 	LIVE It to your fullest and let others Pay</p>
	 	<p> I hope you GET whatever you Want,<br>
	 	So that everywhere you DON'T have to HAUNT</p>
	 	<p> People around you will ADVICE you LOT'S,<br>
	 	But you listen only to YOUR OWN THOUGHT'S</p>
	 	<p> It is time for you to PROVE,<br>
	 		And show the people And make them MOVE</p>
	 	<p> You are the STRONGEST person on my way,<br>
	 	And let me know if to you anyhow I can Slay.</p>
